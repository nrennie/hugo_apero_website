Creating a data science portfolio can help you to develop your skills, and well as showcase them to the wider world. However, getting started on making your portfolio can feel like a huge task. In this talk, I'll discuss how I used #TidyTuesday to gradually build an R portfolio.

We'll run through an example of a #TidyTuesday contribution, including:

* downloading data
* initial data exploration
* creating and styling your plots
* sharing your data visualisations and code

...and just like that, you have a portfolio!
