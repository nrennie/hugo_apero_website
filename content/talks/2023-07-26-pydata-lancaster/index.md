### Abstract

In 2021, I decided I wanted to learn more about effective data visualisation and made the decision to share my progress on Twitter. I'll be talking about how sharing code on social media led to finding a community of people and new opportunities, and I'll discuss one of my recent projects to develop data visualisation guidelines in R and Python.
