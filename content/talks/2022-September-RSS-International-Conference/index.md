### Abstract

Delivering technical presentations is difficult - whether you're explaining statistical concepts, mathematical equations, or code you've developed. It's also hard to define exactly what makes a presentation good. We'll discuss practical tips to avoid common pitfalls (the "what not to do"), and simple changes to improve your presentations (the "what to do instead"). You'll take away a check list that you can use when developing your next presentation to make it easier for you and your audience!
