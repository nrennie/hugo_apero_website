Get ready for the next The Cool Data Projects Show (TCDPS)! Kristen Kehrer will be chatting with Nicola Rennie, Ph.D of Jumping Rivers. Nicola is a data scientist with a doctorate in statistics and a history of building cool shiny apps. In this episode Nicola will be sharing her “shinytweet” app with us. The secret sauce here is that this app uses GitHub actions to automatically update data and redeploy the app! Maybe if we’re lucky she’ll also tell us a bit about her generative art app. Make sure to join us!
