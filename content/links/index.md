#### Contributed blogs

* [Thinging about maps and ice cream](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/2021-thinking-about-maps-and-ice-cream/). *Jumping Rivers*. December 2021. 
Creating 30 maps for the 30 Day Map Challenge in November 2021 was indeed a challenge, but over the course of the month I developed a process for approaching the problem. This blog post will focus on the thought process behind creating maps rather than the technical aspects of writing the code.

#### R Shiny applications

* [Life expectancy](https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/life_expectancy_shiny_app/). 
An R shiny dashboard to accompany upcoming my significance article "We're not getting any younger! Or should that be older?" which investigates trend in life expectancy.

* [aRt](https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/nrennie_aRt/). 
An R shiny application to generate and download generative art created in R.
