### R Packages

Full documentation for the public R packages I have created is available at [nrennie.github.io](https://nrennie.github.io/).

### R Shiny applications

* [aRt](https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/nrennie_aRt/). 
An R shiny application to generate and download generative art created in R.

* [ggplot2-examples](https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/ggplot2-examples/). 
An R shiny application to demonstrate (with code segments) different types of plots in {ggplot2}.

* [Life expectancy](https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/life_expectancy_shiny_app/). 
An R shiny dashboard to accompany my significance article ["We're not getting any younger! Or should that be older?"](https://www.significancemagazine.com/science/723-we-re-not-getting-any-younger-or-should-that-be-older) which investigates trends in life expectancy.

### Tableau 

My data visualisation and dashboard work in Tableau can be found on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicola.rennie).

### Contributed blogs

* [Thinging about maps and ice cream](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/2021-thinking-about-maps-and-ice-cream/). *Jumping Rivers*. December 2021. 
Creating 30 maps for the 30 Day Map Challenge in November 2021 was indeed a challenge, but over the course of the month I developed a process for approaching the problem. This blog post will focus on the thought process behind creating maps rather than the technical aspects of writing the code.

### R-bloggers
