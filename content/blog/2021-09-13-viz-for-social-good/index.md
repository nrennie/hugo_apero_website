## VFSG: Visualize Our Community

Non-profits around the world are driving positive social change but some of them lack the in-house resources to effectively tell their story with the data they have.  Viz For Social Good (VFSG) helps non-profits thrive by connecting talented community members with organizations in need of data visualization skill sets.

In November 2021, Viz For Social Good ran a community poll, the results of which will help shape their diversity & inclusion efforts. 224 people responded from 38 different countries. 


## Sunny Street

Sunny Street is changing the world by providing healthcare to the most vulnerable people in Eastern Australia. One conversation between a Sunny Street volunteer and a patient can change the course of both of their lives.

Although the Covid-19 pandemic caused many clinics to be cancelled, Sunny Street volunteers had the same (or more) conversations and consultations. There has been little change in patient demographic throughout the pandemic.
