#what is gen art

#what are best practices (in coding)

#which are relevant

We’re (hopefully) all familiar with good coding practices. But these …., 
For example, think about reproducibility for a second. It’s standard good coding practice - when someone else runs your code, they should be able to produce an identical output. But is this always desirable? If you could replicate the Mona Lisa at the touch of a button, should you? 
Although I would never claim to be the Leonardo da Vinci of generative art, the world of creative coding does open up questions as to how we define what is a good coding practice. … exploring …. . This then opens up questions of how data scientists define good pratcices on different projects. 
In this talk, we’ll explore whether good coding practices are always good or if they can become not-so-good when the purpose of the code changes.
