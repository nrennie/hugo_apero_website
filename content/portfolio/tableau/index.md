### Tableau

[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/en-gb) is an interactive data visualization tool, used to make plots, dashboards, and presentations of data. Although I primarily use R to create plots and dashbaords for visualising data, I've recently started to explore less-programmatic ways of visualiing data. 

My portfolio of data visualisation is still under construction, and the following represents some preliminary examples of plots and dashboards I have built using Tableau. My Tableau data visualisations and dashboards can be found on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicola.rennie/).

#### Eurovision voting

In order to improve my Tableau skills, I've started visualising [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data sets in Tableau as well as in R. In this example, I recreated the bar chart I built in R of the way countries in the Eurovision *Big 5* (countries with automatic entry to the final) votes. The original chart can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday/tree/main/2022/2022-05-17).

#### Population of Glasgow

As part of the 2021 [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/), I visualised the population in different electoral wards in Glasgow. The rest of my contributions for the challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/nrennie/30DayMapChallenge).

#### Sunflower Seed Production

For the 2022 [#30DayChartChallenge](https://30daychartchallenge.org/), I used Tableau to create a voronoi treemap of sunflower seed production by country. I also created the same map using R, which can be found [here](https://github.com/nrennie/30DayChartChallenge/tree/main/2022#day-4-flora-in-tableau-left-and-r-right).

I then expanded this into a larger dashboard, incorporating further data sources and additional plots.
