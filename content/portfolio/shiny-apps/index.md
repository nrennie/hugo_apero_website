I have developed several {shiny} applications which are hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). 

<h3>aRt: <a href="https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/nrennie_aRt/"> nrennie35.shinyapps.io/nrennie_aRt</a> </h3> 

An R shiny application to generate and download generative art created in R.

<h3>Life Expectancy: <a href="https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/life_expectancy_shiny_app/"> nrennie35.shinyapps.io/life_expectancy_shiny_app</a> </h3> 

An R shiny dashboard to accompany my significance article [Weâ€™re not getting any younger! Or should that be older?](https://www.significancemagazine.com/science/723-we-re-not-getting-any-younger-or-should-that-be-older) which investigates trends in life expectancy.
