I have developed several {shiny} applications which are hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). 

<h3>aRt:</h3><a href="https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/nrennie_aRt/">nrennie35.shinyapps.io/nrennie_aRt</a>

An R shiny application to generate and download generative art created in R.

<h3>Life Expectancy:</h3> <a href="https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/life_expectancy_shiny_app/">nrennie35.shinyapps.io/life_expectancy_shiny_app</a> 

An R shiny dashboard to accompany my significance article [Weâ€™re not getting any younger! Or should that be older?](https://www.significancemagazine.com/science/723-we-re-not-getting-any-younger-or-should-that-be-older) which investigates trends in life expectancy.
